# Machine Learning Project

This project contains machine learning model training notebooks and related resources.

## Getting Started

1. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

To deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. To stop Jupyter Notebook:
   - Press `Ctrl + C` twice in the terminal, or
   - Click "Quit" button in the Jupyter browser interface
